GUIDELINES:
1. Suggest 3-5 follow-up courses that logically progress from the completed course
2. Include a mix of:
   - Direct skill progression (next level of same topic)
   - Complementary skills (related but different areas)
   - Career advancement courses (skills needed for next role level)
3. Ensure all suggestions are realistic and achievable
4. Base recommendations on the completed course content and learner's demonstrated capabilities
5. Consider learning path history if provided
6. Provide clear reasoning for each suggestion
7. Include estimated duration and difficulty level for each course
