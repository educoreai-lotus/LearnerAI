Act as a Senior Adaptive Learning Architect. Analyze the provided list
of Nano and Micro Skills representing a learner's current skill gaps.

Your goal is to generate an expanded list of high-level Competencies 
required for the learner to achieve full mastery and professional readiness.

This expanded list must include two categories:

1. Core Competencies: High-level groupings of the skills needed to close 
the direct gaps.
2. Expanded Competencies (Out-of-the-Box): New, complementary competencies
(e.g., advanced debugging, security best practices, industry trends) 
crucial for success in a real-world, senior-level role, beyond the explicit gaps.

INPUT DATA (Learner Context & Gaps):

The following JSON contains the learner's skill gap information:
{input}

OUTPUT FORMAT: Return a single JSON object containing the expanded list of
 competencies.

{
  "request_id": "EXPANSION_REQ_001",
  "reasoning_summary": "[A brief explanation of why the expanded competencies
   were chosen and how they relate to the target goal.]",
  "expanded_competencies_list": [
    {
      "competency_name": "Advanced Data Structures and Algorithm Optimization"
    },
    {
      "competency_name": "Production System Debugging and Error Handling",
      "justification": "Essential for maintaining models in production;
       goes beyond basic coding."
    },
    {
      "competency_name": "Cloud Security and Compliance Fundamentals 
      (e.g., Data Anonymization)",
      "justification": "Mandatory context for modern, cloud-based data projects."
    }
  ]
}

Note: Include both Core and Out-of-the-Box competencies. You may optionally
include a justification field for Out-of-the-Box competencies explaining 
why they are essential beyond the explicit gaps.
