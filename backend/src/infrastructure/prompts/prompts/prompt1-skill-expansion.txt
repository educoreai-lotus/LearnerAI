Act as a Senior Adaptive Learning Architect. Analyze the provided list
of skills (at the lowest layer) representing a learner's current skill gaps.

Your goal is to generate an expanded list of high-level Technical Competencies 
based on the provided skill gaps. Generate EXACTLY 2 competencies:

1. Core Competency: Group and expand the gap skills into a broader, minimal learning domain
2. Out-of-the-Box Competency: A technical competency that is somewhat related to the gap 
   (not completely unrelated, but expands beyond just grouping the gap skills)

CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: You MUST generate EXACTLY 2 competencies maximum. 

For the Core Competency:
- Group the gap skills into a broader, minimal category
- Expand the gap skills into a broader learning domain (e.g., if gap has "for loop", "conditionals" → "Control Flow and Logic")

For the Out-of-the-Box Competency:
- Choose a technical competency that is somewhat related to the gap domain
- It should be a natural extension or complement to the gap skills
- It should be minimal and high-level (not a detailed list)
- Examples: If gap is Python basics → "Error Handling and Debugging" or "Code Quality and Best Practices"
- DO NOT choose completely unrelated topics (e.g., if gap is Python → don't choose "Web Development" or "Database Design")

MINIMAL COMPETENCY CONSTRAINT: The competencies you generate MUST be MINIMAL and HIGH-LEVEL:
- Each competency should be a broad, high-level category (e.g., "Python Programming Fundamentals", "Software Engineering Practices")
- DO NOT create competencies with many sub-topics or granular details
- DO NOT break down into "baby skills" or micro-skills within the competency name
- Keep competency names concise and focused on the overall domain/area
- Avoid overly specific or narrow competencies that would require many sub-skills
- Think of competencies as major learning domains, not detailed skill lists

Examples of GOOD minimal competencies:
✅ "Python Programming Fundamentals"
✅ "Software Engineering Practices"
✅ "Data Structures and Algorithms"
✅ "System Design and Architecture"

Examples of BAD (too granular, too many topics):
❌ "Python Syntax, Variables, Data Types, Control Flow, Functions, Classes, Modules, Packages"
❌ "Basic Python, Intermediate Python, Advanced Python, Python Libraries, Python Frameworks"
❌ "Error Handling, Debugging, Testing, Logging, Monitoring, Performance Optimization"

COMPETENCY GENERATION RULES:

1. Core Competency (First): Analyze the gap skills and group them into a broader, 
   minimal competency category. For example:
   - If gap has: "for loop", "conditionals", "defining functions" → Create: "Control Flow and Functions"
   - If gap has: "error handling", "debugging" → Create: "Error Handling and Debugging"
   - If gap has: "lists", "dictionaries", "tuples" → Create: "Data Structures"

2. Out-of-the-Box Competency (Second): Choose a technical competency that is 
   somewhat related to the gap domain, but expands beyond just grouping the gap skills.
   It should be a natural technical extension. For example:
   - If gap is Python basics → "Error Handling and Debugging" or "Code Quality and Best Practices"
   - If gap is control flow → "Advanced Programming Patterns" or "Software Design Principles"
   - If gap is data structures → "Algorithm Design" or "Performance Optimization"
   - DO NOT choose completely unrelated topics (e.g., if gap is Python → don't choose "Web Development")

3. Keep minimal and high-level: Both competencies should be broad categories, 
   not detailed lists of sub-topics. Think of them as major technical learning domains.

IMPORTANT: Even if there are many skills, you must consolidate them into 
EXACTLY 2 competencies. Combine related skills into broader, MINIMAL competency 
groupings to meet this constraint.

Remember: Each competency should be a high-level learning domain, not a detailed 
list of topics or sub-skills. Think big picture, not granular details.

INPUT DATA (Learner Context & Gaps):

The following JSON contains the learner's skill gap information:
{input}

OUTPUT FORMAT: Return a single JSON object containing the expanded list of
 competencies.

{
  "request_id": "EXPANSION_REQ_001",
  "reasoning_summary": "[A brief explanation of why the expanded competencies
   were chosen and how they relate to the target goal.]",
  "expanded_competencies_list": [
    {
      "competency_name": "Control Flow and Functions",
      "type": "core"
    },
    {
      "competency_name": "Error Handling and Debugging",
      "type": "out-of-the-box",
      "justification": "Essential technical competency that complements the gap skills"
    }
  ]
}

Note: 
- First competency should group and expand the gap skills into a broader domain
- Second competency should be an out-of-the-box technical competency that is 
  somewhat related to the gap (a natural technical extension), but not completely unrelated

CRITICAL: The expanded_competencies_list MUST contain EXACTLY 2 items. 
Do not exceed this limit. If you have more than 2 competencies, merge 
related ones together to create exactly 2 comprehensive competencies.
