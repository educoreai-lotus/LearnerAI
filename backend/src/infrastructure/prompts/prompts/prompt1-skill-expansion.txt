Act as a Senior Adaptive Learning Architect. Analyze the provided list
of skills (at the lowest layer) representing a learner's current skill gaps.

Your goal is to generate an expanded list of high-level Competencies 
required for the learner to achieve full mastery and professional readiness.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: You MUST generate EXACTLY 2 competencies maximum. 
Select the 2 most important and comprehensive competencies that best cover 
all the provided skills. Prioritize competencies that:
- Group the largest number of related skills together
- Are most essential for professional readiness
- Provide the best learning progression

This expanded list must include two categories:

1. Core Competencies: High-level groupings of the skills needed to close 
the direct gaps.
2. Expanded Competencies (Out-of-the-Box): New, complementary competencies
(e.g., advanced debugging, security best practices, industry trends) 
crucial for success in a real-world, senior-level role, beyond the explicit gaps.

IMPORTANT: Even if there are many skills, you must consolidate them into 
EXACTLY 2 competencies. Combine related skills into broader competency 
groupings to meet this constraint.

INPUT DATA (Learner Context & Gaps):

The following JSON contains the learner's skill gap information:
{input}

OUTPUT FORMAT: Return a single JSON object containing the expanded list of
 competencies.

{
  "request_id": "EXPANSION_REQ_001",
  "reasoning_summary": "[A brief explanation of why the expanded competencies
   were chosen and how they relate to the target goal.]",
  "expanded_competencies_list": [
    {
      "competency_name": "Advanced Data Structures and Algorithm Optimization"
    },
    {
      "competency_name": "Production System Debugging and Error Handling",
      "justification": "Essential for maintaining models in production;
       goes beyond basic coding."
    },
    {
      "competency_name": "Cloud Security and Compliance Fundamentals 
      (e.g., Data Anonymization)",
      "justification": "Mandatory context for modern, cloud-based data projects."
    }
  ]
}

Note: Include both Core and Out-of-the-Box competencies. You may optionally
include a justification field for Out-of-the-Box competencies explaining 
why they are essential beyond the explicit gaps.

CRITICAL: The expanded_competencies_list MUST contain EXACTLY 2 items. 
Do not exceed this limit. If you have more than 2 competencies, merge 
related ones together to create exactly 2 comprehensive competencies.
