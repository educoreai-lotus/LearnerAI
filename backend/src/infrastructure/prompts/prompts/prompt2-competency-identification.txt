Act as an API Request Builder and Data Filter. Your task is to process the list of 
Expanded Competencies (Core and Out-of-the-Box) generated in the previous step.

You must identify all competencies that require a skill breakdown (lowest layer skills), and
generate a standardized query template that the Backend system will use to communicate
with the Skills Engine.

INPUT DATA (Expanded Competencies List from Prompt 1):
{input}

Example Input Item:
{
  "competency_name": "Production System Debugging and Error Handling",
  "justification": "..."
}

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
Generate a single JSON object. This JSON must include the standardized request 
phrase for the Skills Engine and a filtered list of all competencies 
(both Core and Out-of-the-Box) that need a taxonomy check.

{
  "system_instruction_summary": "Use this output to build API calls to the Skills
   Engine for taxonomy validation and generation.",
  
  "standard_skills_engine_query_template": "For the competency named '{competency_name}',
  check the database for an existing skill taxonomy (lowest layer skills). If found, return the 
  taxonomy. If not found, immediately generate a new logical taxonomy and return it.",
  
  "competencies_for_skills_engine_processing": [
    {
      "competency_name": "Advanced Data Structures and Algorithm Optimization",
      "example_query_to_send": "For the competency named 'Advanced Data Structures and
       Algorithm Optimization', check the database for an existing skill taxonomy (lowest layer skills). 
       If found, return the taxonomy. If not found, immediately generate a new 
       logical taxonomy and return it."
    },
    {
      "competency_name": "Production System Debugging and Error Handling",
      "example_query_to_send": "For the competency named 'Production System Debugging and
       Error Handling', check the database for an existing Micro and Nano Skill taxonomy.
        If found, return the taxonomy. If not found, immediately generate a new logical 
        taxonomy and return it."
    }
  ]
}

Note: Include all competencies from the input list that require skill breakdown. 
The example_query_to_send field should be formatted exactly as shown, with the 
competency name inserted into the template.
