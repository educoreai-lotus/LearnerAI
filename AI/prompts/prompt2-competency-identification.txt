Act as an API Request Builder and Data Filter. Your task is to process the list of Expanded Competencies (Core and Out-of-the-Box) generated in the previous step.

You must identify all competencies that require a Micro/Nano Skill breakdown, and generate a standardized query template that the Backend system will use to communicate with the Skills Engine.

INPUT DATA (Expanded Competencies List from Prompt 1):
{input}

Example Input Item:
{
  "competency_name": "Production System Debugging and Error Handling",
  "competency_type": "Out-of-the-Box",
  "target_level": "Intermediate",
  "justification": "..."
}

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
Generate a single JSON object. This JSON must include the standardized request phrase for the Skills Engine and a filtered list of all competencies (both Core and Out-of-the-Box) that need a taxonomy check.

{
  "system_instruction_summary": "Use this output to build API calls to the Skills Engine for taxonomy validation and generation.",
  
  "standard_skills_engine_query_template": "For the competency named '{competency_name}' at proficiency level '{target_level}', check the database for an existing Micro and Nano Skill taxonomy. If found, return the taxonomy. If not found, immediately generate a new logical taxonomy and return it.",
  
  "competencies_for_skills_engine_processing": [
    {
      "competency_name": "Advanced Data Structures and Algorithm Optimization",
      "target_level": "Advanced",
      "source_type": "Core",
      "example_query_to_send": "For the competency named 'Advanced Data Structures and Algorithm Optimization' at proficiency level 'Advanced', check the database for an existing Micro and Nano Skill taxonomy. If found, return the taxonomy. If not found, immediately generate a new logical taxonomy and return it."
    },
    {
      "competency_name": "Production System Debugging and Error Handling",
      "target_level": "Intermediate",
      "source_type": "Out-of-the-Box",
      "example_query_to_send": "For the competency named 'Production System Debugging and Error Handling' at proficiency level 'Intermediate', check the database for an existing Micro and Nano Skill taxonomy. If found, return the taxonomy. If not found, immediately generate a new logical taxonomy and return it."
    }
  ]
}

Note: Include all competencies from the input list that require skill breakdown. The example_query_to_send field should be formatted exactly as shown, with the competency name and target level inserted into the template.
