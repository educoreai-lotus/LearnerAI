# AI Module

This directory contains all AI-related components, models, prompts, and utilities for the LearnerAI project.

## Purpose

The AI module manages:
- **Models**: AI model configurations, fine-tuning data, and model management scripts
- **Prompts**: Prompt templates, prompt engineering utilities, and version control for prompts
- **Utilities**: AI inference logic, API integrations, and helper functions

## Directory Structure

```
ai/
├── models/          # AI model configurations and data
├── prompts/         # Prompt templates and versions
└── utils/           # AI utilities and helpers
```

## Future Development

This module will be expanded as the project evolves to include:
- Model fine-tuning pipelines
- Prompt versioning system
- AI inference endpoints
- Model evaluation metrics
- Integration with various AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
